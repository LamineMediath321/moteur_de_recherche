It is pretty clear, why VR is expected to start a revolution in traditional education. While kids are having VR-based lessons on the daily basis, exploring the galaxies and solar systems, students are learning 3D-body maps and acupuncture, using virtual reality. This all is one huge investment in the future, which is going to cost hundreds of billions soon. China makes a great example, being the first country which has already integrated VR into lessons, though, it is not available for every the educational facility now, due to one main reason: the inability to find and use the educational content which can be easily integrated into the school lessons. The VR industry is still at an early stage of development to provide the society with a qualitative educational content. The software lets up to 30 students watch the scientific movies synchronously, provides a bright and vivid image, and delivers complex ideas about the world in a simple way, with the help of more than 36 films to choose from in astrology, natural science, biology, physics, and paleopathology. The company also provides teachers with all methodical textbooks and manuals to create a fully-edged VR lesson in  the classroom. . During a contest which will be on run from February 25th to March 8th, any school can take part in the giveaway by filling in the application at Science Cinema VR contest website and asking its students to vote. 10 schools with the highest number of votes will get VR Planetarium software for free. The other 15 organizations will be chosen by the team regarding their needs and features of the region. The main goal of the contest is to spread VR education even to the most remote corners of the planet. The other large sector of the event Altair Digital takes over is a cooperation with the charity funds in order to attract investments for purchasing all necessary equipment for integrating VR into schools. The leading telecommunications group in Russia and the CIS already supported the project and have done the first sessions of VR Planetarium in schools towards charitable purposes. “VR Planetarium is not about VR headsets, this is much more. Access to science in VR and its popularization are two key priorities of the project”, says the manager at social responsibility department. To support the mission and achieve the goal, Altair Digital team is organizing a 55-hour marathon, where they are going to contact thousands of organizations to expand the access to VR education in the world. It should available for every student in the world. http://vr2edu.com/?utm_source=media var td_screen_width = document.body.clientWidth; if ( td_screen_width >= 1024 ) { /* large monitors */ document.write('<ins class='adsbygoogle' style='display:inline-block;width:468px;height:60px' data-ad-client='ca-pub-3825284842068330' data-ad-slot='1747798004'></ins>'); . } if ( td_screen_width >= 768 && td_screen_width < 1024 ) { /* portrait tablets */ document.write('<ins class='adsbygoogle' style='display:inline-block;width:468px;height:60px' data-ad-client='ca-pub-3825284842068330' data-ad-slot='1747798004'></ins>'); . } if ( td_screen_width < 768 ) { /* Phones */ document.write('<ins class='adsbygoogle' style='display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px' data-ad-client='ca-pub-3825284842068330' data-ad-slot='1747798004'></ins>'); . }",
